  <p>When I woke up after my first morning nap I heard a strange noise.</p>
  <p>I knew it wasn't me because I told myself not to make any sounds,</p>
  <p>and I always listen to myself and didn't make a sound, not even <em>ONE</em> sound.</p>
  <p>It sounded like pawsteps only squeeky/squishy.</p>
  <p>It may have been <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jaCORjrOL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" 2 dead plopperswidth="100" height="200" /> 2 dead rain soaked ploppers</p>
  <p>tied under something or someone's feet, one for each foot, unless they hopped.</p>
  <p> Maybe 2 more for the front feet which they didn't</p>
  <p>seem to be using just now. Just 2 paw sounds alternating back and forth.</p>
  There was also
  <a href="https://www.classicfm.com/composers/mozart/news/whistle-queen-of-the-night/" target="_blank">a slow leak in the head</a>
  which sounded like the wind,
  <p>but only from the direction of the head, no other wind....very strange.</p>
  <p>It sounded painful...maybe the ploppers were screaming, I don't know.</p>
  <hr>

I stayed very still and counted to 2, ten times.
<p>The ploppers took the sound away and I had another nap.</p>
